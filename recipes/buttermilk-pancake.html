    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Italian meatball soup is a very hearty, flavorful soup. Use whatever small-shaped pasta you like.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>2(14 ounce) cans beef broth</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen cooked Italian-style meatballs</li>
        <li>2 cups frozen italian-blend vegetables</li>
        <li>1 cup small star-shaped dried pasta</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a griddle to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions. </li>
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, salt, and baking soda in a mixing bowl; mix thoroughly. Add 3 cups buttermilk, vegetable oil, and eggs; mix thoroughly by hand with a spoon. Add more buttermilk to adjust consistency if needed. Batter should be slightly lumpy but not too thick; pancakes will be flat if batter is overmixed. </li>
        <li>Working in batches, spoon batter onto the hot griddle. Cook until the bubbles that form on the top surface begin to pop, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until the other side is golden brown, about 2 minutes more.  </li>
    </ol>
